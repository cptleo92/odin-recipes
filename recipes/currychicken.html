    <p>I can eat this all day. I love the savory and spicy curry taste,
        the smooth blend of chicken and rice, and all the vegetables thrown
        in for good measure. <em>Mmm mmm mmm!</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll teach you how to make this amazing dish. It's so simple, yet so 
        good! 
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 drumsticks or equilavent weight in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes</li>
            <li>3 medium onions</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots</li>
            <li>3 medium cups of rice</li>
            <li>3 medium squares of curry roux</li>
       </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Measure out exactly the amount of oatmeal you need. I like using no more than 367 flakes.</li>
           <li>Enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
       <p>(Just kidding. But actually, those instructions are exactly what you need
           do. They even have the ingredients on it. What do you really need me for?</p>
